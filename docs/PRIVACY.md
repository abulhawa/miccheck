# MicCheck Privacy Policy

MicCheck is designed to keep your audio private.

## What We Collect

- **No audio uploads.** All recording, analysis, and scoring happen locally in your browser.
- **No account required.** We do not send recorded audio to our servers.
- **Anonymous product analytics.** We collect non-audio analytics events to understand usage and reliability.

## How Audio Is Used

- The app captures 5-7 seconds of audio to analyze quality.
- Audio is processed locally in your browser.
- To keep playback available across navigation and refresh in the same tab, the latest recording is stored in `sessionStorage`.
- Stored audio is cleared when you start a new test or close the tab.

## Browser Permissions

MicCheck requests access to your microphone solely to record the sample. You can revoke access at any time through your browser settings.
